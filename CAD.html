			<h2>What is Computer Aided Design(CAD)?</h2>
			<p>Computer Aided Design, or CAD for short, is the process of using digital means to create and design a 3D or 2D model which can be printed out using a 3D Printer.</ br>
			It is also used more commonly to create models or simulate physics or the look or material of a design.</p></ br>
			<hr/>
			<h2>What programs do we use for CAD?</h2>
			<p2>Some common programs that are used unclude Maya, Blender, and Fusion360. However, for the purpose of this module, Fusion360 will be used as the main soft</p2>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Tools in Fusion360</h3>

			<p>This is how Fusion360's user interface looks. Now let's go over the different tools the user is given in Fusion360.</p>

			<p>This is the Document Settings tab. You can edit the measurement unit used for the design in this tab.</p>

			<p>These are used to change the view of the model. There is also a Home Icon on the top right allowing you to reset the view to the standard orthographics view.</p>

			<p>This is used to highlight the various axes and planes on different axes.</p>

			<p>This is the Design tab. Click this to access and change the mode of Fusion360. Fusion360 is a versatile software that allows you to do various tasks, and it can be switched between 6 modes. These modes are:
				<div id="Summary"><ol>
					<li>Design: This gives the user access to the Design Workspace, used primarily to create mechanical designs that contain mostly prismatic geometry. You can access commands to create solid bodies. This is the mode I will be primarily using in the course of this module.</li></br>
					<li>Render: This is used to generate realistic renderings of the design.</li></br>
					<li>Animation: This is used to create animations of how the design should be operated or assembled.</li></br>
					<li>Simulation: This mode performs simulation to determine how loads lead to deformation and failure, which can be used to help people identify or determine if and how a part will fail.</li></br>
					<li>Manufacture: This generates tool-path strategies for the design to be fabricated.</li></br>
					<li>Drawing: This is used to load a drawing or animation.</li></ol></br>
