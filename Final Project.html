				<hr/></br></br>
				In preparation for this project, I've done some preliminary research on the ideas I had shortlisted, listed below, along with an evaluation on the feasability of each choice:
				<dl>
					<dt>Mood Lamp</dt>
					<dd>The first idea I had was to make a mood lamp / light based clock, with the light changing based on the time, as shown below.</br>
					<img src="Images/fp1.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br>
					I had also found a similar project to the idea I had in theory, and it can be found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mood-Lamp-with-Arduino/">here.</a></br></br>
					 However, I rejected the idea for two reasons. The first was that I did not know how to program some of the functions, and I felt that it would be fairly redundant and not serve a practical purpose for most people,
					 as their functions can be replaced by other appliances such as mobile phones.</br></br></dd>
					<dt>Useless Machine</dt>
					<dd> I had intended to make a useless machine, but I could not find any interesting designs that could accomplish or serve a practical use, hence I scrapped the idea and moved onto looking at interesting parts 
					that I wanted to try working with. However, an example of what I had intended to do can be found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Most-Useless-Machine-Ever-project/">here.</a></dd></br></br>
					<dt>USB Audio Control device</dt>
					<dd>I found an interesting design that I wanted to try, and found a design that mainly made use of a rotary encoder for all its inputs, managed by an Arduino Nano. It allows the user to switch and cycle through various programs to adjust their audio,
					with a visual indicator to the audio level using an OLED display. Below is a sketch.</br>
					<img src="Images/fp2.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br>
					The idea was heavily inspired by this project by Ruben Henares that uses a program called Maxmix, made for use with Arduino. The official website for its development can be found 
					<a href="https://maxmixproject.com/">here.</a></br>
					Due to my personal interest in the use of the rotary encoder, this is the first selection of projects I would like to do, followed by the mood lamp, and then the useless machine.</br></br></dd></br>		
				</dl>
				</hr></br></br>
				Upon consultation with the lecturer about the idea, he gave the green light for this, on the condition that improvements and changes were made to the design's circuit's housing, and improvements were made to the design
				to serve purposes, and that a few of the materials/electrical components I had wanted could not be used. With this in mind I decided make revisions to the design. All the following changes can be summarised in this section:</br></br>
				<b>1st Revision</b><ul>
					<li>I decided to remove small parts such as the screws and silicon bumpers, as I felt that they were unneccessary and the other parts could be secured in much better ways that used lesser materials, or materials that could be recycled for this purpose.</li>
					<li>I decided to remove the OLED ring as I felt that the visual feedback would not be needed as you would have the screen display for visual feedback, and the sound volume being changed as audial feedback.</li>
					<li>The OLED Display had to be changed due to a lack of availability of the original desired OLED.</li>
					<li>To make changes from the original design by Ruben Henares, I had wanted to make the microboard controller be the Arduino UNO, and make the design have a slot that accomodated both boards.</li>
					<li>I decided to add indicators on the knob for the user to have an easier time using it, so they would know which direction of turning the knob would give them what result.</li>
					<li>I decided to make holes in the base of the box to drain water and provide more air ventilation on the off chance that the parts could overheat if put in a closed box.</li>
					<li>I decided to remove the tray as it was unneccessary.</li>
				</ul></br></br>
				<b>2nd Revision</b><ul>
					<li>I decided to add grooves on the knob to make it easier to hold as I realised that it might be hard to hold since it would be 3D Printed.</li>
					<li>I decided to make the main box laser cut, and parametric, so any of the sides could be removed and reassembled back easily.</li>
					<li>I realised that visual feedback would not be needed, as later versions of most operating systems show up with the audio information on screen if it is changed, and hence decided to remove the OLED display and power bus.</li>
					<li>The UNO was changed to a Digispark ATTiny85.</li>
					<li>I could no longer use the code from the original website I had wanted, and had to change the code.</li>
				</ul></br></br>
				</hr></br></br>
				At this point, I had not yet gotten the measurements of my components, and at this point, I was at the second revision and was putting designing the model off until I had collected the components and could get the physical components as I was worried about the parts that I would receive varying slightly from the actual components,
				but at that point I was running out of time to work on the project, and other modules required a lot of my time, and hence decided to start working on the parts and some room for error and physical adjustment for when I received the parts, taking reference for measurements from the original design by Ruben Henares.</br></br>
				
				First, I started with the knob, as I felt that would be the part that would be the easiest to scale up and down, and used the basic knob made by Ruben Henares, adding the indents on the top of the knob.</br>
				The original design can be found on Thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4343186">here</a>. 
				As intended, I started with the knob, which looked like this:</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp4.jpg" width="530px" height="auto">
				<img src="Images/fp5.jpg" width="530px" height="auto"></br></br>
				This was just plain flat plastic, which can be hard to grip for some people. Additionally, it is unclear of which direction of turning the knob does what, and any other additional features the project might have. 
				Hence, I decided to add some markings on top of the knob. </br></br>
				I started out with making a sketch of the indentations on the top, gauging them to be half the size of my finger, but decided that was too big. Hence, I shrunk the width of the indentations from 8mm to 2.5mm,
				as I felt that if it was too big, it would be hard to tell what the indentation was with a touch of a finger. In hindsight, it should have been large, something like 5mm, as 2.5mm turned out to be too small.</br></br>
				But that is too late to change, so if anyone reads this website and decides to do something similar, do take note to make it large enough that your finger should cover it nicely. As for the actual creation of the indentation,
				I started with a sketch on one side, creating the following sketch, creating the indentations on one side first with a line down the middle.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp6.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				With this done, I simply copied the indentations over and modified the plus to a minus symbol.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp7.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Subsequently, I cut the sketch to a depth of 0.2mm, thinking it would be pretty thick, but not enough that it would get water or any grime stuck inside. But in hindsight, it should have been made deeper.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp8.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				After that, I filleted the edges to remove the sharp edges.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp9.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				After the filleting of this, the indentation was done, and I moved onto the groove. I started mainly with drawing two circles to count outwards, before creating circles on the outer lines slightly overlapping with the edges of the knob.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp10.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				With this done, I cut the circles downward for the grooves.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp11.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				This resuts in the following knob, which was 3D Printed out.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp12.jpg" width="530px" height="auto">
				<img src="Images/fp13.jpg" width="530px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Some problems with this was that the indentations are too smooth, and the plus and minus is too small and smooth. However, the grooves was fine and worked as intended.</br></br>
				<img src="Images/fp14.jpg" width="1060px" height="auto"></br></br>
				To fix this, I used a pen to mark out the indentations.</br></br>
