			<h1>Final Project</h1>

		<div id="Summary">
			<p>
				The Final Project requires us to come up with an idea and work towards making a physical copy of it, using the various techniques we have learned such as:
				<ul>
					<li>Documentation to record the documentation and record the progression of:
						<ul>
							<li>Ideas - The ideas on what can be made and what purposes the design will serve</li>
							<li>Construction - The construction of the actual project should be documented as it progresses, showing the production of the various components and the assembly of all parts.</li>
							<li>How-do (?) </li>
							<li>Instruction Manual - A user's manual on how to operate the various functions of the project's design.</li>
						</ul></br></br>
					<li>CAD and/or Digital Graphic Components</li></br></br>
					<li>2D Cutting and Engraving</li></br></br>
					<li>3D Printed Parts</li></br></br>
					<li>Embedded control with a microcontroller with inputs and outputs</li></br></br>
				</ul>			

				<hr/></br></br>
				<h2>Tasklist</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Research possible ideas</dt>
					<dd>Research more details and look for existing designs that are similar or the same as my ideas.</br>
					Status: Completed</dd></br></br>
					<dt>Check with lecturers on project scope</dt>
					<dd>Check with lecturers on the feasability and safety of the scoped project</br>
					Status: Completed (?) </dd></br></br>
					<dt>Produce Preliminary Sketches</dt>
					<dd>Preliminary Sketches should be produced for a more visual representation of the project idea.</br>
					Status: Completed (?) </dd></br></br>
					<dt>Produce Bill of Materials (BOM)</dt>
					<dd>A bill of materials is used to help identify a total list of items and components that are needed in the prodiction and construction of the project</br>
					Status: Completed</dd></br></br>
					<dt>
					
					
				</dl></br></br>
				<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Arduino Nano</li></br></br>
					<li>1x 128X64 I2C SSD1306 OLED display(uncollected)</li></br></br>
					<li>1x Rotary encoder(uncollected)</li></br></br>
					<li>1x DuPont terminal block pin header 2mm 2 row *5p needle splitter pin header</li></br></br>
					<li>11x 10cm Male to female jumper wires(uncollected)</li></br></br>
				</ol>

				In preparation for this project, I've done some preliminary research on the ideas I had shortlisted, listed below, along with an evaluation on the feasability of each choice:
				<dl>
					<dt>Mood Lamp</dt>
					<dd>The first idea I had was to make a mood lamp / light based clock, with the light changing based on the time, as shown below.
					<img src="Images/fp1.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br>
					 However, I rejected the idea for two reasons. The first was that I did not know how to program some of the functions, and I felt that it would be fairly redundant and not serve a practical purpose for most people,
					 as their functions can be replaced by other appliances such as mobile phones.</br></br></dd>
					<dt>Useless Machine</dt>
					<dd> I had intended to make a useless machine, but I could not find any interesting designs that could accomplish or serve a practical use, hence I scrapped the idea and moved onto looking at interesting parts 
					that I wanted to try working with.</dd></br></br>
					<dt>USB Audio Control device</dt>
					<dd>I found an interesting design that I wanted to try, and found a design that mainly made use of a rotary encoder for all its inputs, managed by an Arduino Nano. It allows the user to switch and cycle through various programs to adjust their audio,
					with a visual indicator to the audio level using an OLED display. Below is a sketch.</dd>
					<img src="Images/fp1.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
					Due to my personal interest in the use of the rotary encoder, this is the first selection of projects I would like to do, followed by the mood lamp, and then the useless machine.
