			<h1>Week 8: Embedded Programming w/ Arduino</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="Summary">
			<p>
				Embedded Programming is the routine of installing hardware to run various pre-programmed functions that contribute to the completion and functionality of a product.
				This can be done on a number of hardware, but there are generally a few things to consider, that being:
				<ul>
					<li>Electrical Components</li>
					<li>Current, Voltage, and Resistance</ul>
					<li>Script/Programming</li>
				</ul>
				These impact the entire circuit in a product in their own way, each needing an equal amount of attention and reviewing for the circuit to function, and hence they will be covered in more detail.</br></br>
				<hr/></br>
				<h2>Electrical Components</h2>
				Electrical Components, alternatively referred to as Electronic Components are devices that use electricity.</br>
				These can include and are not limited to:
				<ul>
					<li>Wires, used to connect components.</li>
					<li>Switches, which open and close a circuit, which essentially turns it on and off.</li>
					<li>Resistors, components that provide resistance to the flow of electricity.</li>
					<li>Capacitors are used to store charge, block DC or allow AC</li>
					<li>Inductors, coils that resist change in current.</li>
					<li>Inductors, that allow or block current.</li>
					<li>Diodes, which allow or block current.</li>
					<li>Transistors, which amplify signals.</li>
					<li>Integrated Circuits which are miniaturized combination of the above items.</li>
				</ul></br></br>
				Electrical Components can be identified by one of two ways, one being their physical appearance or their electronic symbols, as shown below.</br></br>
				Physical Appearance</br>

				Electronic Symbols</br>

				Electronic Symbols can be used to represent electronic circuits, and can be translated manually or electronically into a physical circuit.
				<hr/></br>
				<h2>Current, Voltage and Resistance</h2>
				Electricity is the flow of electricity in a closed circuit. Current, Voltage and Resistance are measurements of various parts of a circuit's calculations.
				<ul>
					<li>Current, which is the rate at which electrical charge flows through a certain point. It is measured in Amperes.</li>
					<li>Voltage refers to the difference in electrical potential between two points. It is measured in Volts.</li>
					<li>Resistance is the measurement of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. It is measured in Ohms.</li>
				</ul>
				When setting up a circuit, current, voltage, and resistance should always be taken into consideration.</br>
				Some formulas commonly used to calculate each of these variables are:
				<ul></br></br>
					<li>Ohms Law:</br>
					Voltage = Current * Resistance ( V = IR )</li></br></br>
					<li>Power</br>
					Power = Voltage * Current</li></br></br>
				</ul>
				<hr/></br>
				<h2>Programming</h2>
				Embedded Programming is derived from the desire to reduce the number of devices in the circuit and the sizes. Originally, a dedicated computer system with dedicated functions were needed to perform specific tasks,	 but due to this
				goal of reducing the size, through the development of the Uno, the circuit was reduced to a single Intergrated Circuit with support devices.</br>
				<img src="Images/ep11.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				This IC and its programming is collectively known as Arduino. An Arduino system comprises of:<ul>
					<li>Software & Software Tools<ul>
						<li>Integrated Development System (IDE)</li>
						<li>Arduino programming language (C++ like) based on Wiring</li>
						<li>Development & Debugging tool based on Processing</li>
						<li>Software libraries ( open source contributions )</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Hardware<ul>
						<li>Atmel processor board</li>
						<li>Shields (Add-on modules)</li>
						<li>Sensors, actuators, peripherals</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Open Source Platform</li></br></br>
				</ul>
				With all of this information, it is ezsy to accidentally draw some misconceptions and mistake somee rumours for actual information. While there may be many miconceptions to cover and debunk, here are some common ones:
				<ul>
					<li>"The board is made up of a microprocessor board."</br>
					This is inaccurate, as what this statement refers to is the Arduino Uno board, not Arduino itself.</li></br>/<br>
					<li>"The board can be used to build projects."</br>
					This is inaccurate as the board is simply used as a control unit to activate or manipulate additional modules to accomplish their intended goal or function in a circuit through the use of code.</li></br>/<br>
					<li>"Programmed in C++"</br>
					Arduino uses a proramming language that derives from C++, and is not C++ itself.</li></br>/<br>
					<li>"Has a lot of clones, which may be incompatible"
					The various Arduino clones, while not being made by the same supplier, can still accomplish and serve the same functions as the genuine board.</li></br>/<br>
				</ul>
				With all this in mind, why should you use Arduino? It is a system made to emulate the capabilities of their larger and more specialised equivalents, but ultimately, it is a system that is made to do what those systems can do.
				<ul>
					<li>Arduino is inexpensive, with the board costing lesser than $5, which is much lesser than what the specialised systems built to </li></br>/<br>
					<li></li></br>/<br>
				</ul>
				<hr/></br>
				<h2>Electronic Protoyping</h2>
				Electronic Prototyping involves using knowledge of electrical components and electricity to create a prototype, serving as an early sample or mockup of the project.</br>
				This allows for testing and odifications to the design as the user sees fit, and can be done with three techniques.</br></br>
				<hr/></br>
				
				<h4>Breadboarding</h4>
				Breadboarding is a a technique that makes use of a breadboard, a construction base for prototyping electronics.</br></br>
				Breadboarding</br>
				<img src="Images/ep3.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Advantages:<ul>
					<li>Does not require soldering</li>
					<li>Allows testing</li>
					<li>Allows modification</li>
				</ul></br></br>
				Disadvantages:<ul>
					<li>Gets complex very easily with more connections</li>
					<li>Loose connections</li>
					<li>May be inaccurate</li>
				</ul>
				Breadboarding Tools:</br></br>

				<hr/></br>
				
				<h4>Stripboarding</h4>
				Stripboardng involves the use of an electronics protoyping board which provides a grid for placement and connectivity of components.</br></br>
				Stripboarding</br>
				<img src="Images/ep7.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Advantages:<ul>
					<li>Can handle simple to relatively complex ciruits</li>
					<li>Can handle a variety of components</li>
					<li>Secure connections</li>
				</ul></br></br>
				Disadvantages:<ul>
					<li>Requires soldering</li>
					<li>Planning needed for complex circuits</li>
					<li>Medium complexity</li>
				</ul>
				Stripboarding Boards:</br></br>
				Veroboard
				<img src="Images/ep8.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Stripboard ( holes only )
				<img src="Images/ep9.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Stripboard ( strips )
				<img src="Images/ep10.JPG" width="1160px" height="auto"></br></br>
				Veroboard is the most common prototype board, requiring some skill, soldering, and tools, but stabled designs can be built, tested, and used.
				<hr/></br>
				
				<h4>Printed Circuit Boards</h4>
				Printed Circuit Boards are boards that connect electronic components using copper tracks, with the components being soldered onto the PCB.</br>
				These PCBs can be single, double, or multi-layered, with each "layer" referring to the conductive copper substrate layer(s) used on the board. These boards are made through two processes, chemical etching and mechanically engraved boards.
				Generally, Mechanically engraved boards are recommended for prototyping over chemical etched boards due to the toxicity of the latter's manufacturing process.</br></br>
