		<div id="Summary">
			<p>
				Embedded Programming is the routine of installing hardware to run various pre-programmed functions that contribute to the completion and functionality of a product.
				This can be done on a number of hardware, but there are generally a few things to consider, that being:
				<ul>
					<li>Hardware's function</li>
					<li>Current, Voltage, and Resistance</ul>
					<li>Script/Programming</li>
				</ul>
				These impact the entire circuit in a product in their own way, each needing an equal amount of attention and reviewing for the circuit to function, and hence they will be covered in more detail.</br></br>
