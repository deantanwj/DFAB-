					<dt>Fablab Safety is important! But how is it maintained?</dt>
						<dd>SP ensures that safety is secured by<ul>
							<img src="Images/fls1.JPG" width="900px" height="auto">
							<li>Setting Rules for Safety Management, which are:<ol>
								<li>Compulsory Safety Instructions & Certification Program for all Students.</li>
								<li>Safety Infrastructure to be visible on shop floor of workshops.</li>
								<li>Safety Patrol</li>
								<li>Compulsory Housekeeping by students after using the machines.</li>
							</ol>
						</ul> 
						</dd>
					</dl><dl>But what is the Workshop Safety and Certification Program?
						<dt>Its objective is to:</dt><dd><ul>
							<li>help students understand WSH regulations in SP and the safe Practises in Fab Lab/workshops,</li>
							<li>and help familiarise students with the safety infrastructure in Fablab/Workshops and to know the various Machine Hazards.</li></ul></dd>
						<dt>In order to attain the Certification, students must attend lessons before sitting for an assessment to be able to use the FabLab.</dt>
							<dd> Failures for the assessment must resit the assesment.*</dd></br>
						<dt>But why must students attend this Workshop?</dt>
							<dd><ul>
								<li>Singapore Polytechnic has a legal responsibility under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act 2006 to ensure a safe working environment.</li>
								<li>To ensure that all students are given appropriate safety and health training related to their field of study.</li></br>
								<img src="Images/fls2.JPG" width="900px" height="auto"></br>
								<li>SP's SAFE Framework needs the students to know how to act and what to do in the case of accidents, which will be taught in the workshop.</li></br>

					<h2>Section 2: Workshop Safety Infrastructure and Safety Communication </h2>
					<dl><font size="6">What is the objective of this section? What will be covered in this Section?</font><br/><br/>
						<font size="4">
						<dt>1. To understand the Safety Infrastructure in workshops and the Fab Lab.</dt><br/><br/>
							<dd>In workshops or Fab Lab, hazard communications  are visible to remind students of workplace hazards and the safety precautions to take at specific work areas, especially when working with a hazardous machineries.</dd><br/><br/>
								<img src="Images/fls4.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto"><br/><br/>
						<dt>2. General Workshop Safety Communications</dt><br/><br/>
								
						<dt>3. Attire for workshops and Fab Lab</dt><br/><br/>
							<dd>This is the proper standard of dressing for Males.<img src="Images/fls5.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto"><br/><br/>
								This is the proper standard of dressing for Females.<img src="Images/fls6.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto"></dd><br/><br/>
						<dt>4. Safety Posters and Safety Warning Placards</dt>
							<dd>Shown below are some examples of Safety Warnings which can be found on the Safety Warning Placards on the various machines.<br/><br/>
							<img src="Images/fls7.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto">
							<img src="Images/fls8.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto"><br/><br/>
							Many of these warnings can be found on Placards on each of the machines, detailing and showing what dangers there are to watch out for while using each machine, as shown below<br/><br/>
							<img src="Images/fls9.JPG" width="1060px" height="auto"><br/><br/>
							On the machine, it will also give step by step instructions for before and after use of the machine.</dd><br/><br/>
