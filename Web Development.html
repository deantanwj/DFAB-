			<p1><font size="3">For Web Development, we will be using various tools such as Markdown and HTML, but in my case, I have chosen to use
			HTML, CSS, and Javascript(JS for short), using Notepad++ to edit and create my website. Brackets is also another viable option if you 
			are considering to try HTML yourself. Aside from these scripting languages, I will also be using Github, a source control tool to 
			publish and show this website publicly.</font>
			<hr/>
			<font size="3">HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language is used to generally configure and control the website's look and functionality, from hyperlinks to the text and content 
			listed on the website. HTML alone is sufficient to create a website, but it is lacking in several areas that CSS and Javascript will be able to help fill and
			assist in covering up for those weaknesses.</font></br></br>
			This section will cover the simple basics of HTML, as well as include some examples of how I have used it to create this very website you are viewing now.</br></br>
			I picked up the basics of HTML from this video listed below:
			<iframe width="1170" height="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWPMSSsVdPk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			First of all, HTML functions primarily due to its structure, but it first needs to be initialised using a statement at the start of a text file using the following line.</br>
			</br><img src="Images/wd1.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			<font size="3">The first line is used to help identify what kind of file this is when it is opened in the browser, using !DOCTYPE to show that the tag, which is what text in angled brackets is referred to in HTML,
			is there to identify what kind of file it is opening, followed by "html" to show that is is a HTML file. From here, we need to lay out a HTML skeleton, as shown below.</font>
			</br><img src="Images/wd2.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			This will allow us to key in text and edit the look of a webpage. The head and body section each affect different things, so let's focus on what we can do in the head section first. We can add a title tag.
			</br><img src="Images/wd3.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			Now that we've keyed in our title, if we save it as a HTML, we should be presented with a blank page with it's title being what we keyed in between the title tags.
			</br><img src="Images/wd4.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			</br><img src="Images/wd5.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			That's about it for the head section. Now, as for the body, most of the content in the page will be made and scripted in this section. There are many tags that can be used here, but I will elaborate on the
			ones I have used the most in the creation of this website. First of all, the header tag.
			</br><img src="Images/wd6.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			</br><img src="Images/wd7.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			This is the header tag, which essentially as the name implies, creates a header. This can be made to range from h1 to h6, the size of each subsequent header getting smaller as the number of headers increase.
			</br><img src="Images/wd8.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			</br><img src="Images/wd9.JPG" width="1100px"></br>
			However, if you feel that you do not wish to use a header and instead want to bold, underline, or format some words, you can use the tags with the individual format names as shown below.
